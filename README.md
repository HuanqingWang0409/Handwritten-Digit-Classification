# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
▪	Identified the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using three classification techniques: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Principal Component Analysis and Convolutional Neural Network.<br />

▪	Random forest method with PCA has misclassification rate of 4.85% on the test set, where 300 trees and 67 principal components were used. The running time was
around 90 seconds.<br />

▪	Logistic regression method has misclassification rate 7.09% and running time 61 sec.<br />

▪	Convolutional Neural Network takes 11.44 sec to train the network, with an error rate of 1.84% on the test set.<br />

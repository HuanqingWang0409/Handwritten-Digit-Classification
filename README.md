# Handwritten Digit Classification
▪	We aimed to identify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using three classification techniques: Logistic Regression, Random Forest with Principal Component Analysis and Convolutional Neural Network.<br />

▪	Random forest method with PCA had misclassification rate of 4.85% on the test set, where 300 trees and 67 principal components were used. The running time was
around 90 seconds.<br />

▪	Logistic regression method had misclassification rate 7.09% and running time 61 sec.<br />

▪	Convolutional Neural Network had misclassification rate 1.84% and running time 11.44 sec.<br />
